  - ✅ Consolidated configuration management
  - ✅ Created backward compatibility layer

- ✅ Phase 3: Core Module Consolidation
  - ✅ Consolidated DHT components into dht_core_utils module
  - ✅ Created network_utils module for UDP socket, server, client, and HTTP components

## Current Status

The project is currently in the later stages of optimization. Phase 1 (Foundation and Infrastructure) has been completed, establishing the baseline metrics and implementing precompiled headers. This has resulted in an 8.5% improvement in build time.

Phase 2 (Component Consolidation) has been completed, with all utility modules successfully consolidated. This has reduced the number of utility files and improved code organization. The utility consolidation focused on grouping related functionality into cohesive modules:

1. **common_utils**: String, hash, file, and filesystem utilities
2. **system_utils**: Thread, process, and memory utilities
3. **domain_utils**: Network, node, and metadata utilities
4. **misc_utils**: Random and JSON utilities
5. **config_utils**: Configuration management

Phase 3 (Core Module Consolidation) has now been completed. We have successfully consolidated the DHT components into the dht_core_utils module, created the network_utils module for UDP and HTTP components, and created the event_utils module for the event system. We have also consolidated the node lookup, peer lookup, message handling, and transaction management components into their respective modules and updated references throughout the codebase to use the consolidated components. This has resulted in a significant 45% improvement in build time, reducing it from 1m 46.92s to 0m 58.77s.

### Current Metrics
- **File Count**: 238 C++ files (.cpp and .hpp) (13% reduction from baseline)
- **Lines of Code**: 58,500 lines (13% reduction from baseline)
- **Build Time**: 0m 58.77s (50% improvement from baseline)

### Target Metrics
- **File Count**: < 150 C++ files
- **Lines of Code**: < 40,000 lines
- **Build Time**: < 1m

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
- Some components have excessive inheritance hierarchies
- Some code duplication in network handling
- Inconsistent error handling approaches

### Performance Issues
- Memory usage grows over time during long crawling sessions
- Some inefficient algorithms in routing table management
- Metadata download prioritization could be improved

### Build Issues
- Debug builds are significantly slower than release builds
- Some platform-specific compilation warnings
- Dependency management could be improved

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Evolution
- Initially started with a monolithic design
- Evolved to a highly modular architecture with many small files
- Now moving towards a balanced approach with fewer, more cohesive files

### Build System Evolution
- Started with basic Makefiles
- Migrated to CMake for better cross-platform support
- Recently migrated to Meson for improved build times and configuration

### Component Design Evolution
- Initially used deep inheritance hierarchies
- Gradually moving towards composition and flatter hierarchies
- Adopting more event-driven communication between components

### Programming Style Evolution
- Started with C++11 features
- Gradually adopted C++17 features
- Now using C++23 features for more concise and efficient code
