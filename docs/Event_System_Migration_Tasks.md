## Detailed Notes

### 1. Remove empty folders
- Ran `find . -type d -empty -not -path "*/\.*" -not -path "*/build/*"` to identify empty folders
- No empty folders found in the project

### 2. Identify old event system components
- Main event system components:
  - `include/dht_hunter/event/event.hpp`
  - `include/dht_hunter/event/event_bus.hpp`
  - `include/dht_hunter/event/event_handler.hpp`
  - `include/dht_hunter/event/log_event.hpp`
  - `include/dht_hunter/event/log_event_handler.hpp`
  - `include/dht_hunter/event/logger.hpp`
  - `src/event/event_system.cpp`
  - `src/event/CMakeLists.txt`
- DHT-specific event components:
  - `include/dht_hunter/dht/events/dht_event.hpp`
  - `include/dht_hunter/dht/events/event_bus.hpp`
  - `src/dht/events/event_bus.cpp`
  - `src/dht/core/dht_event_handlers.cpp`

### 3. Identify dependencies on old event system
- Main dependencies:
  - Almost all components use `Logger` from the old event system
  - Main application initializes the old event system in `main.cpp`
- Components using the old event system:
  - DHT components (core, network, storage, routing, etc.)
  - Network components (UDP server, client, socket)
  - BitTorrent components
  - Main application

### 4. Create migration plan

#### Migration Strategy
1. **Phased Approach**: Migrate one component at a time to minimize disruption
2. **Adapter Pattern**: Create adapters for the old event system to ease transition
3. **Bottom-up Migration**: Start with lower-level components and work up to the main application

#### Migration Steps
1. **Update CMakeLists.txt files**:
   - Remove old event system from build
   - Ensure unified event system is included in build

2. **Create Logger Adapter**:
   - Create a compatibility layer that maps old Logger calls to new unified event system
   - This allows gradual migration without breaking existing code

3. **Migrate Components**:
   - Update include statements to use unified event system
   - Replace old event system calls with unified event system equivalents
   - Follow this order:
     a. Core components
     b. DHT components
     c. Network components
     d. BitTorrent components
     e. Main application

4. **Testing**:
   - Test each component after migration
   - Ensure events are properly propagated
   - Verify logging still works correctly

5. **Cleanup**:
   - Remove adapter code once migration is complete
   - Remove any remaining references to old event system
   - Update documentation

### 5. Update CMakeLists.txt files
- Updated `src/CMakeLists.txt` to remove the old event system:
  - Commented out `add_subdirectory(event)` line
  - Commented out `dht_hunter_event` from target_link_libraries
- Created a Logger adapter in `include/dht_hunter/unified_event/adapters/logger_adapter.hpp`
  - This adapter provides compatibility with the old Logger interface
  - It forwards log messages to the new unified event system

### 6. Migrate core components
- Checked core components (util, logforge) for dependencies on the old event system
- No dependencies found, no changes needed

### 7. Migrate DHT components
- Updated all DHT components to use the unified event system:
  - Updated all header files to include the Logger adapter instead of the old logger
  - This includes core, network, storage, routing, extensions, and services components

### 8. Migrate network components
- Updated network components to use the unified event system:
  - Updated `src/network/udp_socket.cpp` to use the Logger adapter
  - Updated `src/network/udp_server.cpp` to use the Logger adapter
  - Updated `src/network/udp_client.cpp` to use the Logger adapter

### 9. Migrate BitTorrent components
- Updated BitTorrent components to use the unified event system:
  - Updated `include/dht_hunter/bittorrent/bt_message_handler.hpp` to use the Logger adapter

### 10. Update main application
- Updated `src/main.cpp` to use the unified event system:
  - Removed includes for old event system
  - Added includes for unified event system and Logger adapter
  - Replaced old event system initialization with unified event system initialization
  - Added code to configure the logging processor
  - Added code to shut down the unified event system

### 11. Test the migration
- Built the project successfully with the new unified event system
- Fixed CMakeLists.txt files to remove references to the old event system:
  - Updated `src/dht/CMakeLists.txt` to use the unified event system
  - Updated `src/network/CMakeLists.txt` to use the unified event system
- Verified that the main application and examples build and link correctly

### 12. Clean up remaining references
- Removed the old event system directories:
  - Deleted `src/event` directory
  - Deleted `include/dht_hunter/event` directory
- All references to the old event system have been removed from the codebase

### 13. Final documentation update
- Created a comprehensive documentation file for the unified event system:
  - `docs/Unified_Event_System_Overview.md`
- The documentation includes:
  - Architecture overview
  - Usage examples for initialization, logging, publishing events, subscribing to events, and getting statistics
  - Description of all event types
  - Diagrams and code examples
