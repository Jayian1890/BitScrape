# Configuration System Implementation Summary

## Overview

The configuration system has been successfully implemented, allowing users to customize all aspects of the DHT Hunter application through a single JSON configuration file. The system is modular, well-documented, and follows best practices for configuration management in C++ applications.

A key user-friendly feature is the automatic generation of a default configuration file if one doesn't exist at the specified location. This ensures that the application always has a valid configuration to work with, eliminating the need for manual configuration file creation.

4. **Updated DHT Core Components** ✅
   - Modified DHTConfig to load from the configuration system
   - Updated the DHT node initialization to use the configuration
   - Implemented configuration for bootstrap nodes

5. **Updated Network Components** ✅
   - Modified UDPServer to use the configuration system
   - Updated transaction manager to use configurable limits

6. **Updated Web Interface** ✅
   - Modified WebServer to use the configuration system
   - Updated API endpoints to reflect configuration changes

7. **Updated Persistence System** ✅
   - Modified PersistenceManager to use the configuration system
   - Updated save intervals and file paths based on configuration

8. **Updated Crawler Components** ✅
   - Modified Crawler to use the configuration system
   - Updated crawler parameters based on configuration

9. **Updated Metadata Acquisition System** ✅
   - Modified MetadataAcquisitionManager to use the configuration system
   - Updated acquisition parameters based on configuration

10. **Created Documentation** ✅
    - Created detailed user documentation for all configuration options
    - Created developer documentation for the configuration system architecture
    - Included examples and best practices

## Completed Optional Tasks

1. **Implement Hot-Reloading** ✅
   - Added file watching for the configuration file
   - Implemented safe reloading of configuration values
   - Added events for configuration changes

2. **Add Configuration API Endpoints** ✅
   - Created API endpoints to view current configuration
   - Added endpoints to modify configuration

## Implementation Details

### Configuration Manager

The `ConfigurationManager` class is implemented as a singleton that provides methods to load, save, and access configuration values. It uses the JSON parser to read and write configuration files, and provides type-safe accessors for different types of configuration values.

```cpp
// Get the singleton instance
auto configManager = utility::config::ConfigurationManager::getInstance();

// Get configuration values
std::string webRoot = configManager->getString("web.webRoot", "web");
int dhtPort = configManager->getInt("dht.port", 6881);
bool enableLogging = configManager->getBool("event.enableLogging", true);
```

### Default Configuration

The default configuration file includes all configurable settings with detailed comments. It is organized into logical categories:

- General settings
- DHT settings
- Network settings
- Web interface settings
- Persistence settings
- Crawler settings
- Metadata acquisition settings
- Event system settings
- Logging settings

### Component Integration

Components have been updated to use the configuration system in the following ways:

1. **UDPServer**: Added a new `start()` method that loads the port from configuration.
2. **TransactionManager**: Added configuration for transaction timeout and maximum transactions.
3. **WebServer**: Added a new constructor that loads settings from configuration.
4. **PersistenceManager**: Added configuration for save intervals and file paths.
5. **CrawlerConfig**: Added a new constructor that loads settings from configuration.
6. **CrawlerManager**: Updated to use the configuration-based CrawlerConfig.
7. **MetadataAcquisitionManager**: Added configuration for processing interval, concurrent acquisitions, timeout, retry count, and retry delay.
8. **ConfigurationManager**: Added hot-reloading capability with file watching and change notifications.
9. **ConfigApiHandler**: Added API endpoints for viewing and modifying configuration values.

### Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been created for both users and developers:

1. **User Documentation**: Describes all configuration options, their default values, and how to customize them.
2. **Developer Documentation**: Explains the configuration system architecture and how to add new configuration options.

## Conclusion

The configuration system has been successfully implemented, allowing users to customize all aspects of the DHT Hunter application through a single JSON configuration file. The system is modular, well-documented, and follows best practices for configuration management in C++ applications.

All core components have been updated to use the configuration system, and comprehensive documentation has been created for both users and developers. The optional tasks (hot-reloading and API endpoints) have also been implemented, providing a complete and robust configuration system.

The hot-reloading feature allows the application to detect changes to the configuration file and automatically reload it without requiring a restart. This is particularly useful for long-running applications where downtime should be minimized.

The API endpoints provide a way for users to view and modify the configuration through the web interface, making it easier to manage the application's settings without having to edit the configuration file directly.
