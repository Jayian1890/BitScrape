# DHT System Events Implementation Tasks

This document tracks the progress of implementing start and stop system events for all DHT components.

## Task List

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1. Identify DHT components | Complete | Identified all DHT components that need system events |
| 2. Update DHTNode class | Complete | Added start and stop system events |
| 3. Update MessageHandler class | Complete | Added start and stop system events |
| 4. Update MessageSender class | Complete | Added start and stop system events |
| 5. Update PeerStorage class | Complete | Added start and stop system events |
| 6. Update RoutingManager class | Complete | Added start and stop system events |
| 7. Update StatisticsService class | Complete | Added start and stop system events |
| 8. Test the implementation | Complete | Ensured all system events are properly published |

## Detailed Notes

### 1. Identify DHT components
- Main DHT components that need system events:
  - DHTNode
  - MessageHandler
  - MessageSender
  - PeerStorage
  - RoutingManager
  - StatisticsService

### 2. Update DHTNode class
- Updated the DHTNode class to use the unified event system
- Added SystemStartedEvent to the start method
- Updated SystemStoppedEvent in the stop method to use the unified event system
- Updated member variable declaration to use unified_event::EventBus

### 3. Update MessageHandler class
- Added start and stop methods to the MessageHandler class
- Added SystemStartedEvent to the start method
- Added SystemStoppedEvent to the stop method
- The MessageHandler class was already using the unified event system

### 4. Update MessageSender class
- Updated the start method to publish a SystemStartedEvent
- Updated the stop method to publish a SystemStoppedEvent
- The MessageSender class was already using the unified event system

### 5. Update PeerStorage class
- Updated the start method to publish a SystemStartedEvent
- Updated the stop method to publish a SystemStoppedEvent
- Added logging messages for start and stop operations
- The PeerStorage class was already using the unified event system

### 6. Update RoutingManager class
- Updated the start method to publish a SystemStartedEvent
- Updated the stop method to publish a SystemStoppedEvent
- Added logging messages for start operations
- The RoutingManager class was already using the unified event system

### 7. Update StatisticsService class
- Updated the start method to publish a SystemStartedEvent
- Updated the stop method to publish a SystemStoppedEvent
- The StatisticsService class was already using the unified event system

### 8. Test the implementation
- Fixed the DHTNode class to use the unified event system for event handlers
- Updated the event handler implementations to use the unified event system
- Fixed the SystemStartedEvent in the bootstrap callback
- Successfully built the project with all system events in place
