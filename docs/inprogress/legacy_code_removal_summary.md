# Legacy Code Removal Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the removal of legacy utility code after the successful consolidation of string, hash, file, and filesystem utilities into the new consolidated utility module.

## Removed Files

The following legacy files have been removed from the codebase:

1. `include/dht_hunter/utility/string/string_utils.hpp`
2. `src/utility/string/string_utils.cpp`
3. `include/dht_hunter/utility/hash/hash_utils.hpp`
4. `src/utility/hash/hash_utils.cpp`
5. `include/dht_hunter/utility/file/file_utils.hpp`
6. `src/utility/file/file_utils.cpp`
7. `include/dht_hunter/utility/filesystem/filesystem_utils.hpp`
8. `src/utility/filesystem/filesystem_utils.cpp`

## Updated Files

The following files were updated to use the new consolidated utilities:

1. `include/dht_hunter/utility/utility.hpp` - Updated to include the new consolidated utilities
2. `include/utils/utility.hpp` - Created to provide a central include point for all consolidated utilities
3. `include/dht_hunter/utility/common/common_utils.hpp` - Simplified to forward to the new consolidated utilities
4. `src/types/node_id.cpp` - Updated to use the new consolidated utilities
5. `src/bittorrent/metadata/metadata_exchange.cpp` - Updated to use the new consolidated utilities
6. `include/dht_hunter/bittorrent/metadata/metadata_persistence.hpp` - Updated to use the new consolidated utilities
7. `src/bittorrent/metadata/dht_metadata_provider.cpp` - Updated to use the new consolidated utilities

## Build System Changes

The following build system changes were made:

1. `src/utils/CMakeLists.txt` - Created for the new consolidated utilities
2. `src/utility/CMakeLists.txt` - Updated to remove the consolidated files and link with the new utilities
3. `src/CMakeLists.txt` - Updated to include the new utils directory

## Metrics

### File Count
- Original file count for string, hash, file, and filesystem utilities: 8 files
- Consolidated file count: 2 files
- **Reduction: 6 files (75% reduction)**

### Code Organization
- Improved organization through logical namespaces
- Eliminated redundancy in utility functions
- Simplified include structure
- Improved code readability and maintainability

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge**: Dependency on OpenSSL for SHA1 implementation
  - **Solution**: Implemented a simplified SHA1 function that doesn't require external dependencies

- **Challenge**: Updating references to removed files
  - **Solution**: Created a backward compatibility layer in utility.hpp that forwards to the new consolidated utilities

- **Challenge**: Ensuring backward compatibility
  - **Solution**: Used namespace aliases to maintain the same API while using the new implementation

## Next Steps

The next steps in the optimization process are:

1. Continue with Phase 2.3: Consolidate Network and Domain Utilities
   - Create consolidated header file
   - Create consolidated implementation file
   - Merge network, node, and metadata utilities
   - Update references
   - Test consolidated utilities

2. Continue with Phase 2.4: Consolidate System Utilities
   - Create consolidated header file
   - Create consolidated implementation file
   - Merge thread, process, and memory utilities
   - Update references
   - Test consolidated utilities
