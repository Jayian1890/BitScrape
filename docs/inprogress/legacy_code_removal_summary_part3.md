# Legacy Code Removal Summary - Part 3

## Overview

This document summarizes the removal of legacy thread, process, and memory utility code after the successful consolidation of these utilities into the new system_utils module.

## Removed Files

The following legacy files have been removed from the codebase:

1. `src/utility/thread/thread_pool.cpp`
2. `src/utility/thread/thread_utils.cpp`
3. `src/utility/process/process_utils.cpp`
4. `src/utility/system/memory_utils.cpp`

## Updated Files

The following files were updated to use the new consolidated utilities:

1. `include/dht_hunter/utility/thread/thread_utils.hpp` - Updated to forward to the new consolidated utilities
2. `include/dht_hunter/utility/thread/thread_pool.hpp` - Updated to forward to the new consolidated utilities
3. `include/dht_hunter/utility/process/process_utils.hpp` - Updated to forward to the new consolidated utilities
4. `include/dht_hunter/utility/system/memory_utils.hpp` - Updated to forward to the new consolidated utilities
5. `include/dht_hunter/utility/legacy_utils.hpp` - Updated to include system_utils.hpp and provide backward compatibility
6. `include/utils/utility.hpp` - Updated to include the system_utils.hpp file
7. `src/utility/CMakeLists.txt` - Updated to remove the legacy implementation files

## Backward Compatibility Approach

To maintain backward compatibility with existing code that still includes the legacy headers, we took the following approach:

1. Updated the `legacy_utils.hpp` file to include the new consolidated utilities and provide the same namespace structure as the legacy utilities.
2. Updated the legacy header files to include the `legacy_utils.hpp` file, which forwards to the new consolidated utilities.
3. For the process utilities, which used a class-based approach, we created wrapper methods that call the new free functions.

This approach allows existing code to continue using the legacy headers without any changes, while still benefiting from the consolidated utilities.

## Build System Changes

The following build system changes were made:

1. Removed the legacy implementation files from the `dht_hunter_utility` library in `src/utility/CMakeLists.txt`.
2. Added the new system_utils.cpp file to the `bitscrape_utils` library in `src/utils/CMakeLists.txt`.
3. Physically removed the legacy implementation files from the codebase.

## Metrics

### File Count
- Original implementation file count: 4 files
- Removed implementation files: 4 files
- **Reduction: 4 files (100% reduction in implementation files)**

### Code Organization
- Improved organization through logical namespaces
- Eliminated redundancy in utility functions
- Simplified include structure
- Improved code readability and maintainability

## Next Steps

The next steps in the optimization process are:

1. Proceed to Phase 3: Core Module Consolidation
   - Consolidate DHT core components
   - Consolidate network components
   - Consolidate event system components
   - Update references
   - Test consolidated components

2. After completing Phase 3, proceed to Phase 4: BitTorrent and Metadata Consolidation
   - Consolidate BitTorrent components
   - Consolidate metadata components
   - Update references
   - Test consolidated components
