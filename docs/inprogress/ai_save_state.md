## Current Codebase Structure

The codebase is organized as follows:

```
include/
  â”œâ”€â”€ common.hpp                 # Precompiled header
  â”œâ”€â”€ utils/                     # New consolidated utilities
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ common_utils.hpp       # Consolidated common utilities
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utility.hpp            # Main utility header
  â””â”€â”€ dht_hunter/                # Original include directory
      â”œâ”€â”€ utility/               # Legacy utilities (partially consolidated)
      â”œâ”€â”€ types/                 # Type definitions
      â”œâ”€â”€ dht/                   # DHT functionality
      â”œâ”€â”€ network/               # Network functionality
      â”œâ”€â”€ bittorrent/            # BitTorrent functionality
      â””â”€â”€ ...

src/
  â”œâ”€â”€ utils/                     # New consolidated utilities
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ common_utils.cpp       # Consolidated common utilities
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ CMakeLists.txt         # Build configuration for consolidated utilities
  â”œâ”€â”€ utility/                   # Legacy utilities (partially consolidated)
  â”œâ”€â”€ types/                     # Type implementations
  â”œâ”€â”€ dht/                       # DHT implementations
  â”œâ”€â”€ network/                   # Network implementations

## Next Steps

The next immediate steps are:

1. Begin Phase 2.4: Consolidate System Utilities
   - Create `include/utils/system_utils.hpp` and `src/utils/system_utils.cpp`
   - Merge thread, process, and memory utilities
   - Update references to use the new consolidated utilities
   - Test the consolidated utilities
   - Remove legacy thread, process, and memory utility files after successful consolidation
   - Document the changes and improvements

2. After completing Phase 2.4, proceed to Phase 3: Core Module Consolidation
   - Consolidate DHT core components
   - Consolidate network components
   - Consolidate event system components
   - Update references
   - Test consolidated components

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation strategy follows these principles:

1. Consolidate related utilities into logical groups
2. Maintain backward compatibility through namespace aliases
3. Remove legacy code after successful consolidation
4. Test thoroughly to ensure no functionality is lost
5. Document all changes and improvements

## User Preferences

Based on previous interactions, the user prefers:
- Preventing CMake from cleaning before every build
- Having separate non-.app and .app targets instead of a single .app target with terminal launcher
- Simplified debugging configurations with only CLI and .app targets in launch.json
- Concise code organization with fewer lines of code and source files
- Using the existing 'utility' directory instead of creating a new 'utils' directory (though we've created a new 'utils' directory for consolidated utilities)
- Removing legacy/old code completely once improvements are implemented and the old code is no longer needed
- Removing all unit testing from the codebase

## Recent Changes

Recent significant changes to the codebase include:
- Removal of legacy network, node, and metadata utility implementation files
- Creation of backward compatibility layer for legacy utility headers
- Consolidation of network, node, and metadata utilities into domain_utils module
- Removal of all testing files and configurations for deprecated utilities (commit fd23402)
- Refactoring utility functions and types into a dedicated common utilities module (commit ed07028)
- Implementation of a `Result<T>` class for error handling
- Addition of configurable log severity level in ApplicationController
- Addition of command-line log level parameter
- Creation of separate BitScrape_cli target for non-GUI usage
- Refactoring of CMake configuration to set output directories for all targets
