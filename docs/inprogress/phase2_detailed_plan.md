# BitScrape Optimization: Phase 2 Detailed Plan

This document outlines the detailed steps for implementing Phase 2 of the BitScrape optimization plan, which focuses on utility consolidation.

## Phase 2: Utility Consolidation

### 2.1 Analyze Utility Dependencies

**Objective:** Map dependencies between utility classes and identify consolidation opportunities.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Identify all utility files:**
   - List all utility files in the codebase
   - Categorize them by functionality (string, file, network, etc.)
   - Document their locations and purposes

2. **Map dependencies between utilities:**
   - Identify which utilities depend on other utilities
   - Create a dependency graph to visualize relationships
   - Identify circular dependencies that need to be resolved

3. **Identify similar functionality:**
   - Look for utilities with overlapping functionality
   - Identify redundant implementations of similar functions
   - Document opportunities for consolidation

4. **Group utilities by domain:**
   - Group utilities into logical domains (common, domain-specific, system)
   - Plan the namespace structure for consolidated utilities
   - Document the grouping plan

### 2.2 Consolidate String and File Utilities

**Objective:** Merge string, hash, file, and filesystem utilities into a single consolidated module.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Create consolidated header file:**
   - Create `include/utils/common_utils.hpp`
   - Set up namespace structure for different utility types
   - Add forward declarations and includes

2. **Create consolidated implementation file:**
   - Create `src/utility/common_utils.cpp`
   - Set up namespace structure matching the header file
   - Prepare file structure for merged implementations

3. **Merge string utilities:**
   - Copy string utility functions into the common_utils namespace
   - Refactor to eliminate redundancy
   - Update function signatures for consistency
   - Add appropriate documentation

4. **Merge hash utilities:**
   - Copy hash utility functions into the common_utils namespace
   - Refactor to eliminate redundancy
   - Update function signatures for consistency
   - Add appropriate documentation

5. **Merge file utilities:**
   - Copy file utility functions into the common_utils namespace
   - Refactor to eliminate redundancy
   - Update function signatures for consistency
   - Add appropriate documentation

6. **Merge filesystem utilities:**
   - Copy filesystem utility functions into the common_utils namespace
   - Refactor to eliminate redundancy
   - Update function signatures for consistency
   - Add appropriate documentation

7. **Update references:**
   - Find all references to the original utility files
   - Update includes to use the new consolidated header
   - Update function calls to use the new namespace structure
   - Test to ensure all references are updated correctly

### 2.3 Consolidate Network and Domain Utilities

**Objective:** Merge network, node, and metadata utilities into a single domain-specific utility module.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Create consolidated header file:**
   - Create `include/utils/domain_utils.hpp`
   - Set up namespace structure for different utility types
   - Add forward declarations and includes

2. **Create consolidated implementation file:**
   - Create `src/utility/domain_utils.cpp`
   - Set up namespace structure matching the header file
   - Prepare file structure for merged implementations

3. **Merge network utilities:**
   - Copy network utility functions into the domain_utils namespace
   - Refactor to eliminate redundancy
   - Update function signatures for consistency
   - Add appropriate documentation

4. **Merge node utilities:**
   - Copy node utility functions into the domain_utils namespace
   - Refactor to eliminate redundancy
   - Update function signatures for consistency
   - Add appropriate documentation

5. **Merge metadata utilities:**
   - Copy metadata utility functions into the domain_utils namespace
   - Refactor to eliminate redundancy
   - Update function signatures for consistency
   - Add appropriate documentation

6. **Update references:**
   - Find all references to the original utility files
   - Update includes to use the new consolidated header
   - Update function calls to use the new namespace structure
   - Test to ensure all references are updated correctly

### 2.4 Consolidate System Utilities

**Objective:** Merge thread, process, and memory utilities into a single system utility module.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Create consolidated header file:**
   - Create `include/utils/system_utils.hpp`
   - Set up namespace structure for different utility types
   - Add forward declarations and includes

2. **Create consolidated implementation file:**
   - Create `src/utility/system_utils.cpp`
   - Set up namespace structure matching the header file
   - Prepare file structure for merged implementations

3. **Merge thread pool:**
   - Copy thread pool implementation into the system_utils namespace
   - Refactor to eliminate redundancy
   - Update function signatures for consistency
   - Add appropriate documentation

4. **Merge thread utilities:**
   - Copy thread utility functions into the system_utils namespace
   - Refactor to eliminate redundancy
   - Update function signatures for consistency
   - Add appropriate documentation

5. **Merge process utilities:**
   - Copy process utility functions into the system_utils namespace
   - Refactor to eliminate redundancy
   - Update function signatures for consistency
   - Add appropriate documentation

6. **Merge memory utilities:**
   - Copy memory utility functions into the system_utils namespace
   - Refactor to eliminate redundancy
   - Update function signatures for consistency
   - Add appropriate documentation

7. **Update references:**
   - Find all references to the original utility files
   - Update includes to use the new consolidated header
   - Update function calls to use the new namespace structure
   - Test to ensure all references are updated correctly
