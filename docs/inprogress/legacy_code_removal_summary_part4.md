# Legacy Code Removal Summary - Part 4: DHT Core Components

## Overview

This document summarizes the removal of legacy DHT core components that have been consolidated into the new DHT core utilities module.

## Files Removed

The following files have been removed from the codebase:

1. **DHT Node**
   - `include/dht_hunter/dht/core/dht_node.hpp`
   - `src/dht/core/dht_node.cpp`

2. **Routing Table**
   - `include/dht_hunter/dht/core/routing_table.hpp`
   - `src/dht/core/routing_table.cpp`

3. **DHT Configuration**
   - `include/dht_hunter/dht/core/dht_config.hpp`
   - `src/dht/core/dht_config.cpp`

4. **Persistence Manager**
   - `include/dht_hunter/dht/core/persistence_manager.hpp`
   - `src/dht/core/persistence_manager.cpp`

5. **DHT Constants**
   - `include/dht_hunter/dht/core/dht_constants.hpp`
   - `src/dht/core/dht_constants.cpp`

## Replacement

These components have been consolidated into the following new files:

- `include/utils/dht_core_utils.hpp`
- `src/utils/dht_core_utils.cpp`

## Changes to Build Configuration

The following changes were made to the build configuration:

1. **src/dht/CMakeLists.txt**
   - Removed references to the removed files
   - Added comments indicating that the components have been moved to `utils/dht_core_utils.cpp`
   - Added a dependency on the `bitscrape_utils` library

## Updated References

2. **include/dht_hunter/bittorrent/metadata/dht_metadata_provider.hpp**
   - Replaced `#include "dht_hunter/dht/core/dht_node.hpp"` with `#include "utils/dht_core_utils.hpp"`

3. **src/dht/core/dht_event_handlers.cpp**

6. **include/dht_hunter/dht/routing/components/base_routing_component.hpp**
   - Replaced `#include "dht_hunter/dht/core/dht_config.hpp"` and `#include "dht_hunter/dht/core/routing_table.hpp"` with `#include "utils/dht_core_utils.hpp"`

7. **include/dht_hunter/dht/routing/routing_manager.hpp**
   - Replaced `#include "dht_hunter/dht/core/dht_config.hpp"` and `#include "dht_hunter/dht/core/routing_table.hpp"` with `#include "utils/dht_core_utils.hpp"`

8. **include/dht_hunter/dht/extensions/factory/extension_factory.hpp**
   - Replaced `#include "dht_hunter/dht/core/dht_config.hpp"` and `#include "dht_hunter/dht/core/routing_table.hpp"` with `#include "utils/dht_core_utils.hpp"`

9. **include/dht_hunter/dht/extensions/dht_extension.hpp**
   - Replaced `#include "dht_hunter/dht/core/dht_config.hpp"` with `#include "utils/dht_core_utils.hpp"`

10. **include/dht_hunter/dht/extensions/implementations/mainline_dht.hpp**
    - Replaced `#include "dht_hunter/dht/core/routing_table.hpp"` with `#include "utils/dht_core_utils.hpp"` (via the DHT extension include)
    - Updated ambiguous references to `RoutingTable` to use `dht::RoutingTable`

11. **include/dht_hunter/dht/extensions/implementations/kademlia_dht.hpp**
    - Replaced `#include "dht_hunter/dht/core/routing_table.hpp"` with `#include "utils/dht_core_utils.hpp"` (via the DHT extension include)
    - Updated ambiguous references to `RoutingTable` to use `dht::RoutingTable`

12. **include/dht_hunter/dht/extensions/implementations/azureus_dht.hpp**

    - Updated ambiguous references to `RoutingTable` to use `dht::RoutingTable`

## Benefits

The consolidation of DHT core components has resulted in the following benefits:

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**
   - Eliminated duplicate code across multiple files
   - Centralized common functionality in a single module

2. **Improved Maintainability**
   - Simplified the codebase structure
   - Made it easier to understand and modify DHT core functionality

3. **Better Organization**
   - Grouped related functionality together
   - Provided a clear separation of concerns

4. **Reduced Build Time**
   - Fewer files to compile
   - More efficient header inclusion

5. **Improved Thread Safety**
   - Consistent thread safety patterns across all components
   - Better handling of singleton instances

## Next Steps

The next steps in the consolidation process are:

1. **Phase 3.2: Network Components Consolidation**
   - Consolidate network components into a unified utility module
   - Follow the same pattern of consolidation, testing, and cleanup

2. **Phase 3.3: Event System Components Consolidation**
   - Consolidate event system components into a unified utility module
   - Follow the same pattern of consolidation, testing, and cleanup
