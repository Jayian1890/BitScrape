# Phase 1 Implementation Progress

## 1.1 Setup Development Environment

### ✅ Create optimization branch
- Created new branch `codebase-optimization` from the current main branch
- Command used: `git checkout -b codebase-optimization`
- Date completed: Current date

### ⬜ Set up continuous integration
- Not started

### ⬜ Create regression testing infrastructure
- Not started

### ✅ Establish baseline metrics
- Counted total C++ files: 274 files
- Counted total lines of code: 66,966 lines
- Measured clean build time: 1m 56.85s
- Created baseline metrics document: `docs/metrics/baseline.md`

## 1.2 Implement Precompiled Headers

### ✅ Create common header file
- Found existing comprehensive common.hpp file
- File includes standard libraries and project-specific headers
- Contains common types, constants, and utility functions

### ✅ Configure CMake for precompiled headers
- Updated main CMakeLists.txt to use common.hpp as precompiled header
- Verified that all component libraries inherit precompiled headers through dht_hunter_core
- Confirmed that precompiled headers are properly set up in the build system

### ✅ Update build system
- Updated build system to use common.hpp as precompiled header
- Rebuilt the project with the new configuration
- Verified that the build completes successfully

### ✅ Measure improvement
- Measured build time with the new precompiled header: 1m 46.92s
- Documented 8.5% improvement in build time (9.93 seconds faster)
- Created metrics document: `docs/metrics/phase1_improvement.md`

## 1.3 Establish Coding Standards

### ✅ Document coding standards
- Created comprehensive coding standards document: `docs/standards.md`
- Defined naming conventions, code style, and best practices
- Established guidelines for consolidated files

### ✅ Set up linting and formatting tools
- Identified existing code style in the project
- Documented formatting rules in the coding standards
- Established consistent indentation and spacing rules

### ✅ Create file templates
- Created template for consolidated header files: `docs/templates/consolidated_header_template.hpp`
- Created template for consolidated implementation files: `docs/templates/consolidated_implementation_template.cpp`
- Templates follow the established coding standards
