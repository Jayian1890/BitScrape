# DHT-Hunter: Not Implemented Features

This document lists the features from the Network-Layer-Design.md document that are not yet implemented or are only partially implemented.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Status: **Partially Implemented**
   - Socket creation and basic operations are tested.
   - The following tests are not implemented:
     - Address parsing and validation
     - Buffer management
     - Rate limiting algorithms

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Status: **Not Implemented**
   - The following tests are not implemented:
     - End-to-end UDP message exchange
     - TCP connection establishment and data transfer
     - Cross-platform compatibility

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Status: **Not Implemented**
   - The following tests are not implemented:
     - Throughput measurement
     - Connection handling capacity
     - Memory usage under load

4. **Stress Tests**
   - Status: **Not Implemented**
   - The following tests are not implemented:
     - Handling of network errors and timeouts
     - Recovery from connection failures
     - Behavior under high connection counts

## Performance Optimization

1. **Performance Profiling and Tuning**
   - Status: **Not Implemented**
   - This is the last item in Phase 5 of the implementation phases and is not yet completed.
   - Performance profiling and tuning should be done to optimize the network layer for high throughput and low latency.
