# Active Context: BitScrape

## Current Work Focus

The current focus of the BitScrape project is **codebase optimization**. This involves reducing the number of source files and lines of code while maintaining functionality and readability. The optimization is being carried out in phases, with each phase focusing on specific aspects of the codebase.

### Optimization Goals
1. Reduce the number of source files
2. Decrease lines of code
3. Improve build times
4. Enhance code maintainability
5. Preserve functionality and performance

## Recent Changes

### Phase 1: Foundation and Infrastructure
- Created optimization branch `codebase-optimization`
- Established baseline metrics (274 files, 66,966 lines of code, 1m 56.85s build time)
- Implemented precompiled headers
- Achieved 8.5% improvement in build time (9.93 seconds faster)

### Phase 2: Component Consolidation (Completed)
- Analyzed utility dependencies and identified consolidation opportunities
- Consolidated string, hash, file, and filesystem utilities into common_utils module
- Consolidated thread, process, and memory utilities into system_utils module
- Consolidated network, node, and metadata utilities into domain_utils module
- Consolidated random and JSON utilities into misc_utils module
- Consolidated configuration management into config_utils module
- Created backward compatibility layer for legacy code

### Build System Migration (Completed)
- Migrated from CMake to Meson build system
- Created build.sh script for common build tasks
- Set up VS Code integration for Meson

### Phase 3: Core Module Consolidation (Completed)
- Consolidated DHT components into dht_core_utils module
- Created network_utils module for UDP socket, server, client, and HTTP components
- Created event_utils module for event system, event bus, and event processors
- Consolidated node lookup and peer lookup components into dht_core_utils module
- Consolidated message handling and transaction management into network_utils module
- Updated references to use the consolidated components
- Achieved 45% improvement in build time (58.08 seconds faster)

## Next Steps

### Phase 4: Code Reduction
- Replace verbose patterns with modern C++ features
- Inline simple methods
- Flatten inheritance hierarchies where appropriate
- Use composition over inheritance
- Measure improvement in build time and code metrics

### Phase 5: File Structure Reorganization
- Reorganize file structure to be more module-based
- Move related files into logical directories
- Standardize file naming conventions
- Measure improvement in build time and code metrics

### Phase 6: Testing and Documentation
- Write comprehensive unit tests for components
- Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
- Create examples of how to use the consolidated components

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Modular Architecture**: Maintain a modular architecture where each component is an independent library that can be used in any project without dependencies on other components.
- **Event-Driven Design**: Continue using an event-driven architecture to prevent operations from deadlocking the entire program.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Prefer std::async over direct thread management for asynchronous operations.
- **Consolidated Core Modules**: Group related functionality into consolidated utility modules for better organization and reduced build time.

### Implementation Decisions
- **File Organization**: Consolidate related files while maintaining logical separation of concerns.
- **Code Style**: Prefer more concise code organization with fewer lines of code and source files.
- **Legacy Code**: Remove legacy/old code completely once improvements are implemented.
- **Directory Structure**: Use existing 'utility' directory instead of creating a new 'utils' directory.

### Build System Decisions
- **Meson vs CMake**: Use Meson as the primary build system, completely removing CMake.
- **Build Targets**: Create separate non-.app and .app targets instead of a single .app target with terminal launcher.
- **Debug Configurations**: Simplify debugging configurations with only CLI and .app targets in launch.json.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Prefer fewer, more cohesive files over many small files
- Group related functionality into logical modules
- Use namespaces for organization rather than deep class hierarchies

### Programming Style
- Use modern C++ features (auto, lambdas, ranges)
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use std::async for asynchronous operations
- Implement event-driven communication between components

### Documentation
- Document public APIs with clear comments
- Maintain up-to-date README files
- Use Memory Bank for project-level documentation

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Performance Optimizations
- Precompiled headers significantly improve build times
- Consolidating related files reduces compilation overhead
- Modern C++ features can lead to more concise and efficient code
- Core module consolidation resulted in a 45% improvement in build time
- Reduced file count by 13% and lines of code by 13% through consolidation

### Architecture Improvements
- Event-driven architecture improves component decoupling
- Modular design allows for better code reuse
- Flatter hierarchies are often easier to understand and maintain

### Development Process
- Measuring baseline metrics is essential for tracking improvements
- Phased approach allows for incremental progress
- Regular testing ensures functionality is preserved during optimization
