# DHT-Hunter Project Reorganization Tracking

## Project Reorganization Plan

This document tracks the progress of reorganizing the DHT-Hunter project into 5 modular components:

1. **Types Module**: Core data types and structures used across the application
2. **Network Module**: Low-level networking functionality

## Current Status

We've successfully reorganized the project into modular components:

2. **Network Module**: Refactored to use the Types module
3. **BitTorrent Module**: Refactored to use the Types module
4. **DHT Module**: Refactored to use the Types module
   - Implemented binary format for persistence
   - Removed JSON utilities and functions
   - Reorganized storage functionality
   - Reorganized DHT extensions with factory pattern
   - Implemented proper directory structure for extensions
   - Reorganized routing functionality with modular components
   - Implemented interfaces for routing components

   - Reorganized peer lookup functionality with modular components
   - Reorganized bootstrap functionality with modular components
   - Reorganized crawler functionality with modular components

5. **Unified Event Module**: Refactored to use the Types module
   - Updated to use string formatting instead of JSON
6. **Main Application**: Updated to use the new modular structure
   - Set log severity level to Info
   - Removed verbose mode flag

The project now builds successfully with the new modular structure.

### Next Steps

1. Continue improving the modular structure by:
   - Further separating concerns between modules
   - Enhancing interfaces between modules
   - Removing any remaining dependencies on old types

2. Consider implementing additional features or optimizations based on the new modular structure

## Notes

1. When moving types to the Types module, we need to be careful about hash specializations for custom types. We encountered an issue with the InfoHash type, which required updating the peer_storage.hpp file to use the Types module's InfoHash.

2. We need to make sure that all files that use the old types are updated to use the new Types module.

3. We're encountering conflicts between the old types and the new types. We need to either:
   - Remove the old types completely and update all references to use the new types
   - Create a more gradual migration path where we keep both for a while but ensure they don't conflict

4. The current approach of using the dht_types_adapter.hpp file is causing conflicts because it's trying to import types that already exist in the DHT module. We need to rethink this approach.

5. We've updated our approach to resolve the conflicts:
   - Created a new types.hpp file in the DHT module that imports only the non-conflicting types from the Types module
   - Updated the response_message.hpp file to use the EndPoint type directly instead of network::EndPoint
   - Updated the logging_processor.cpp file to use the types::NetworkAddress type instead of network::NetworkAddress

## Summary

In this reorganization effort, we've successfully:

1. Created a new Types module with core data types moved from other modules
2. Refactored the Network module to use the Types module
3. Refactored the BitTorrent module to use the Types module
4. Refactored the DHT module to use the Types module
   - Implemented binary format for persistence
   - Removed JSON utilities and functions
   - Reorganized storage functionality
5. Refactored the Unified Event module to use the Types module
   - Updated to use string formatting instead of JSON
6. Updated the main application to use the new modular structure
   - Set log severity level to Info
   - Removed verbose mode flag
7. Resolved type conflicts and ensured the project builds successfully

We've achieved our goal of having a clean, modular codebase with clear separation of concerns between the five main components: Types, Network, BitTorrent, DHT, and Unified Event. This new structure will make the codebase more maintainable, with better defined interfaces between components and a more logical organization of code.
