# DHT Node Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for implementing a new DHT node that behaves exactly like a normal DHT node, following the BitTorrent DHT protocol (BEP 5).

## Overview

The DHT node will be implemented using:
- Network components for UDP communication
- LogForge for event-based logging
- Event system for component communication
- Modular architecture for maintainability

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Core Components

- [ ] Define DHT constants (timeouts, k-bucket size, etc.)
- [ ] Implement DHT types (NodeID, InfoHash, etc.)
- [ ] Create DHT node configuration
- [ ] Implement routing table with k-buckets

### 2. Network Components

- [ ] Implement socket manager for UDP communication
- [ ] Create message classes for DHT protocol
  - [ ] Base message class
  - [ ] Query messages (ping, find_node, get_peers, announce_peer)
  - [ ] Response messages
  - [ ] Error messages
- [ ] Implement message sender
- [ ] Implement message handler

### 3. Routing Components

- [ ] Implement routing manager
- [ ] Create node lookup mechanism
- [ ] Implement peer lookup mechanism

### 4. Storage Components

- [ ] Implement token manager for security
- [ ] Create peer storage for storing peer information

### 5. Transaction Components

- [ ] Implement transaction manager
- [ ] Create transaction persistence mechanism

### 6. Bootstrap Components

- [ ] Implement bootstrapper for initial node discovery

### 7. Integration

- [ ] Connect all components
- [ ] Implement DHT node main class
- [ ] Add event-based logging

### 8. Testing

- [ ] Test basic functionality
- [ ] Test against real DHT network
- [ ] Verify all DHT requests and responses

## Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each component should have a single responsibility
2. **Simplicity**: Keep the implementation as simple as possible
3. **Accuracy**: Follow the DHT protocol specification exactly
4. **Event-Based**: Use events for communication between components
5. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## DHT Protocol Implementation

The implementation will support all standard DHT messages:

### Queries
- `ping`: Check if a node is alive
- `find_node`: Find the k closest nodes to a target node ID
- `get_peers`: Get peers for a torrent info hash
- `announce_peer`: Announce that you are downloading a torrent

### Responses
- Response to `ping`: Confirm the node is alive
- Response to `find_node`: Return k closest nodes
- Response to `get_peers`: Return peers or closest nodes
- Response to `announce_peer`: Confirm the announcement

### Error Messages
- Protocol errors
- Server errors
- Generic errors

## Progress Tracking

This document will be updated as implementation progresses to track completion of each component.
