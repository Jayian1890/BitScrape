# DHT Core Refactoring

This document describes the refactoring of the DHT core components to improve code organization and reduce dependencies.

## Overview

The DHT core components were refactored to consolidate functionality and reduce dependencies between modules. The main changes include:

1. Moved DHT core functionality from `dht/core/` to `utils/dht_core_utils.hpp` and `utils/dht_core_utils.cpp`
2. Simplified the DHTNode class to provide a cleaner interface
3. Added support for metadata acquisition through the DHT

## Key Changes

### 1. DHT Core Consolidation

The DHT core functionality was consolidated into two main files:

- `include/utils/dht_core_utils.hpp`: Contains the declarations for DHT core classes
- `src/utils/dht_core_utils.cpp`: Contains the implementations for DHT core classes

This consolidation reduces the number of files and simplifies the codebase.

### 2. DHTNode Interface

The DHTNode class was simplified to provide a cleaner interface:

- Made the constructor public to allow direct instantiation
- Added public methods for sending queries to nodes and finding nodes with metadata
- Simplified the configuration options

### 3. Metadata Acquisition Support

Added support for metadata acquisition through the DHT:

- Implemented the `findNodesWithMetadata` method in the DHTNode class
- Made the `sendQueryToNode` method public to allow direct queries to nodes
- Updated the metadata provider to use these methods

## Implementation Details

### DHTNode Class

The DHTNode class now provides the following public methods:

```cpp
// Constructor
DHTNode(const DHTConfig& config, const types::NodeID& nodeID);

// Send a query to a node
bool sendQueryToNode(
    const types::NodeID& nodeId,
    std::shared_ptr<dht::QueryMessage> query,
    std::function<void(std::shared_ptr<dht::ResponseMessage>, bool)> callback);

// Find nodes that might have metadata for an info hash
void findNodesWithMetadata(
    const types::InfoHash& infoHash,
    std::function<void(const std::vector<std::shared_ptr<dht::Node>>&)> callback);
```

### DHTConfig Class

The DHTConfig class was simplified to provide only the essential configuration options:

```cpp
class DHTConfig {
public:
    DHTConfig();
    // ... other methods
};
```

### Application Controller Updates

The ApplicationController was updated to work with the new DHTNode and DHTConfig classes:

- Simplified the creation of the DHTNode
- Updated the handling of routing table and peer storage
- Removed direct access to routing manager and peer storage

## Benefits

This refactoring provides several benefits:

1. **Reduced Code Complexity**: Fewer files and simpler interfaces make the code easier to understand and maintain.
2. **Improved Encapsulation**: The DHTNode class now provides a cleaner interface for interacting with the DHT.
3. **Better Separation of Concerns**: The DHT core functionality is now more clearly separated from other components.
4. **Easier Metadata Acquisition**: The new methods make it easier to acquire metadata through the DHT.

## Related Changes

The following files were modified as part of this refactoring:

1. `src/dht/crawler/components/crawler_manager.cpp`: Removed dependency on dht_constants.hpp
2. `src/core/application_controller.cpp`: Updated to work with the new DHTNode and DHTConfig classes
3. `include/utils/dht_core_utils.hpp`: Added new methods for metadata acquisition
4. `src/utils/dht_core_utils.cpp`: Implemented new methods for metadata acquisition

## Testing

The changes were tested by building the project and verifying that it compiles successfully. The application was also run to ensure that it starts up correctly.

## Future Improvements

While this refactoring improves the codebase, there are still opportunities for further improvements:

1. **Further Consolidation**: More DHT-related functionality could be consolidated into the DHTNode class.
2. **Better Error Handling**: The error handling in the DHT core could be improved to provide more detailed error information.
3. **More Efficient Metadata Acquisition**: The metadata acquisition process could be optimized to reduce network traffic and improve performance.

## Conclusion

The DHT core refactoring has successfully consolidated the DHT core components into a unified utility module, resulting in a more maintainable, efficient, and thread-safe implementation. The addition of support for metadata acquisition through the DHT is a significant improvement that enhances the functionality of the BitScrape application.
