# Phase 2 Implementation Progress

## 2.1 Analyze Utility Dependencies

### ✅ Identify all utility files
- Identified 15 utility implementation files (.cpp)
- Identified 16 utility header files (.hpp)
- Categorized utilities by functionality

### ✅ Map dependencies between utilities
- Analyzed dependencies between utility files
- Identified common_utils.hpp as a core dependency
- Created dependency graph

### ✅ Identify similar functionality
- Identified overlapping functionality in string and hash utilities
- Identified overlapping functionality in file and filesystem utilities
- Identified related functionality in network, node, and metadata utilities
- Identified related functionality in thread, process, and memory utilities

### ✅ Group utilities by domain
- Grouped utilities into three main categories:
  - Common utilities (string, hash, file, filesystem)
  - Domain utilities (network, node, metadata)
  - System utilities (thread, process, memory)
- Designed namespace structure for consolidated utilities

### ✅ Create dependency documentation
- Created comprehensive dependency documentation: `docs/dependencies/utilities.md`
- Documented consolidation opportunities
- Outlined consolidation plan
- Defined namespace structure for consolidated utilities

## 2.2 Consolidate String and File Utilities

### ✅ Create consolidated header file
- Created `include/utils/common_utils.hpp`
- Set up namespace structure for different utility types
- Added forward declarations and includes
- Organized utilities into logical namespaces

### ✅ Create consolidated implementation file
- Created `src/utils/common_utils.cpp`
- Set up namespace structure matching the header file
- Prepared file structure for merged implementations
- Added necessary includes for implementation

### ✅ Merge string utilities
- Copied string utility functions into the common_utils namespace
- Maintained original function signatures for compatibility
- Added appropriate documentation
- Implemented all string utility functions

### ✅ Merge hash utilities
- Copied hash utility functions into the common_utils namespace
- Maintained original function signatures for compatibility
- Added appropriate documentation
- Implemented all hash utility functions

### ✅ Merge file utilities
- Copied file utility functions into the common_utils namespace
- Maintained original function signatures for compatibility
- Added appropriate documentation
- Implemented all file utility functions

### ✅ Merge filesystem utilities
- Copied filesystem utility functions into the common_utils namespace
- Maintained original function signatures for compatibility
- Added appropriate documentation
- Implemented all filesystem utility functions

### ✅ Update build system
- Created CMakeLists.txt for the consolidated utilities
- Updated main CMakeLists.txt to include the new utils directory
- Set up proper dependencies and include paths
- Configured the build system to build the consolidated utilities

### ✅ Update references
- Updated build system to use the consolidated utilities
- Added the new utils directory to the build system
- Configured the build system to build the consolidated utilities first
- Kept the legacy utilities for backward compatibility during transition

### ✅ Test consolidated utilities
- Built the project with the consolidated utilities
- Verified that the build completes successfully
- Confirmed that the consolidated utilities are properly linked

## 2.3 Consolidate Network and Domain Utilities

### ✅ Create consolidated header file
- Created `include/utils/domain_utils.hpp`
- Set up namespace structure for different utility types
- Added forward declarations and includes
- Organized utilities into logical namespaces

### ✅ Create consolidated implementation file
- Created `src/utils/domain_utils.cpp`
- Set up namespace structure matching the header file
- Prepared file structure for merged implementations
- Added necessary includes for implementation

### ✅ Merge network utilities
- Copied network utility functions into the domain_utils namespace
- Maintained original function signatures for compatibility
- Added appropriate documentation
- Implemented all network utility functions

### ✅ Merge node utilities
- Copied node utility functions into the domain_utils namespace
- Maintained original function signatures for compatibility
- Added appropriate documentation
- Implemented all node utility functions

### ✅ Merge metadata utilities
- Copied metadata utility functions into the domain_utils namespace
- Maintained original function signatures for compatibility
- Added appropriate documentation
- Implemented all metadata utility functions

### ✅ Update references
- Updated utility.hpp to include the new domain_utils.hpp
- Added backward compatibility namespace aliases
- Updated CMakeLists.txt to build the new domain_utils.cpp file
- Kept the legacy utilities for backward compatibility during transition

### ✅ Test consolidated utilities
- Built the project with the consolidated utilities
- Verified that the build completes successfully
- Confirmed that the consolidated utilities are properly linked
