# BitScrape Optimization: Phase 1 Detailed Plan

This document outlines the detailed steps for implementing Phase 1 of the BitScrape optimization plan, which focuses on establishing the foundation and infrastructure for the codebase optimization.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Infrastructure

### 1.1 Setup Development Environment

**Objective:** Create an isolated development environment for optimization work with proper testing infrastructure.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Create optimization branch:**
   - Create a new git branch from the current main/master branch
   - Document branch creation in the project documentation

2. **Set up continuous integration:**
   - Ensure CI pipeline is configured for the new branch
   - Configure build and test automation
   - Set up code quality metrics tracking

3. **Create regression testing infrastructure:**
   - Identify critical functionality to test
   - Create basic test suite to verify core functionality
   - Ensure tests can be run automatically

4. **Establish baseline metrics:**
   - Measure and document current compilation time
   - Count and document current lines of code (LOC)
   - Count and document current file count
   - Document current build size and performance metrics

### 1.2 Implement Precompiled Headers

**Objective:** Reduce compilation time by implementing precompiled headers for common includes.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Create common header file:**
   - Create `include/common.hpp` file
   - Add standard library includes (vector, string, map, etc.)
   - Add project-wide common headers
   - Organize includes in logical sections

2. **Configure CMake for precompiled headers:**
   - Update main CMakeLists.txt to support precompiled headers
   - Configure target properties for precompiled headers
   - Set up proper include paths

3. **Update build system:**
   - Modify build scripts to support precompiled headers
   - Test build system changes
   - Document build system modifications

4. **Measure improvement:**
   - Compare compilation time before and after changes
   - Document improvement in metrics file

### 1.3 Establish Coding Standards

**Objective:** Define clear coding standards for the optimized codebase to ensure consistency.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Document coding standards:**
   - Define naming conventions
   - Establish file organization guidelines
   - Document code style preferences
   - Define comment and documentation requirements
   - Establish guidelines for consolidated files

2. **Set up linting and formatting tools:**
   - Configure clang-format for code formatting
   - Set up linting tools for code quality checks
   - Create configuration files for automated tools

3. **Create file templates:**
   - Create templates for consolidated header files
   - Create templates for consolidated implementation files
   - Document template usage guidelines

## Implementation Checklist

### 1.1 Setup Development Environment
- [ ] Create optimization branch
- [ ] Configure CI pipeline
- [ ] Create basic test suite
- [ ] Measure and document baseline metrics

### 1.2 Implement Precompiled Headers
- [ ] Create common.hpp with standard includes
- [ ] Configure CMake for precompiled headers
- [ ] Update build system
- [ ] Measure and document compilation time improvement

### 1.3 Establish Coding Standards
- [ ] Document coding standards
- [ ] Configure linting and formatting tools
- [ ] Create file templates for consolidated files

## Success Criteria

Phase 1 will be considered complete when:

1. A new optimization branch is created and properly configured
2. Precompiled headers are implemented and working correctly
3. Baseline metrics are documented
4. Coding standards are established and documented
5. Build time shows measurable improvement
6. All tests pass with the new infrastructure

## Next Steps After Phase 1

Once Phase 1 is complete, we will proceed to Phase 2: Utility Consolidation, which focuses on consolidating utility functions and reducing the number of small utility files.
