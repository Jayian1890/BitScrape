## Conclusion and Next Steps

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to optimizing and modernizing the BitScrape codebase. By following this plan, we expect to achieve:

- **Reduced File Count**: From 121 to 35 files (-71%)
- **Code Size Reduction**: From ~20,000 to ~12,000-14,000 LOC (-30-40%)
- **Improved Compilation Time**: 40-60% reduction
- **Better Maintainability**: Easier navigation, logical grouping, reduced context switching
- **Modern C++ Features**: Improved type safety, concurrency, and error handling

After completing this plan, the next steps would be:

1. Evaluate the impact of the changes
2. Identify further optimization opportunities
3. Consider additional modernization efforts (e.g., C++20/23 features)
4. Plan for continuous improvement of the codebase
